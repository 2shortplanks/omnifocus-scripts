# Mark's Random OmniFocus Scripts

These are a collection of my Random OmniFocus 2 Pro scripts.

To use them yourself place them in your OmniFocus scripts folder.  You can
ask OmniFocus to open this folder by selecting `Help` -> `Open Scripts Folder`.
Once the scripts are in this folder, you can put them on your toolbar simply
by right clicking on the toolbar, selecting `Customize Toolbar...` and then
dragging them onto the toolbar.

## Accessibility

Some of the scripts (e.g. "In Context" and "In Projects") work by simulating
clicks on the menus.  In order for this to work you need to do the following

* Open System Preferences
* Click on `Security and Privacy`
* Click on `Accessibility`
* If the icon in the bottom left is "locked" then you need to click on it and enter your password
* Click the `+` icon
* Select OmniFocus and click `Open`
